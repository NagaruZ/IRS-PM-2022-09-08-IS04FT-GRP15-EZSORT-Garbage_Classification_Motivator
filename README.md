EZSORT- Intelligent Garbage Classification Motivator


# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Nowadays, all the social members, from presidents to residents, acknowledge the impertinence of sustainable development than ever before. As such, the transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions must occur as soon as feasibly possible. Cities can do their part by embracing a wide range of options. Singapore government also try its best to create a carbon and climate resilient future. Transformations are happening everywhere, neither is huge or small in industry, economy and society such as more renewable energy, greater energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption and so on. Improving energy efficiency is a key focus of our efforts to reduce emissions, cited in Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) of Singapore. 

Many processes of waste treatment such as fermentation, transportation, incineration and landfill are important sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, which also aggravates the scarcity of land resources (IPCC). So, there are significant and reasonable we need to enhance our waste management system for a low-carbon and green future. Inevitable requirement of urban sustainable development. It can reduce the amount of waste incineration and landfill, improve the recyclability of garbage, promote a circular economy and green development. Finally, all these efforts lead to a much lower carbon emission and environmental pollution.

To improve the garbage collection rate, a solution is put forward, solving the problem from the source. We propose an Intelligent Garbage Classification Motivator, in order to encourage citizens to throw-in the garbage correctly as its’ classifications. 

***EZSORT*** is committed to influencing and making difference at the source of waste collecting. The system is based on the exist trash cans using an embedded design. In this way, rich functions can be realized with low cost. We will make full use of existing infrastructure, public resources and market education foundation. 

***EZSORT*** is easy to be used with high accuracy. When people put garbage into the dustbin, the sound sensor in the system will obtain the sound of garbage falling and the machine learning model we developed will automatically recognize the type of garbage. The model is based on sound’s MFCC features extracting and HMM (Hidden Markov Model). Then the intelligent reasoning and interaction will be done. 

***EZSORT*** has vivid and inspiring interaction. The system interacts visually with users through the screen, and feedback the environmental benefits brought by correct classification, so as to achieve the purpose of encouraging citizens to correctly classify and throw domestic garbage. 

We hope ***EZSORT*** can be the platform to rise the people awareness and provide a window to allow them to step out. We believe this small action can be a big step tomorrow.
